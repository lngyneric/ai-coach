# Claude Rule: Testing And Commit

Use this Claude-only rule to route testing and commit hygiene without
duplicating the shared repository guidance already stored in `AGENTS.md`.

- Prefer the nearest `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` pair before reading any
  deeper path-specific rule in this folder.

- Before changing code, inspect the current implementation and reuse existing
  abstractions where possible instead of building a parallel solution from
  scratch.

- Keep the repository hard rules visible in the primary manual docs:
  English-only code-facing text, no hardcoded user-facing strings or secrets,
  and shared-contract doc updates in the same change.

- Use `docs/engineering-baseline.md` for the stable engineering handbook, and
  use the layered `AGENTS.md` files for AI execution rules.

- Before each commit, review the nearest `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files for
  the touched areas; if the implementation change makes them inaccurate,
  update those docs in the same commit.

- For complex design work, create `docs/<topic>.md` before implementation and
  track execution in repository-root `tasks.md` with markdown checkboxes that
  explicitly link back to the design document.

- When `tasks.md` exists, follow its checklist order unless you first update
  the checklist to reflect a deliberate reprioritization.

- After completing each checklist item, update `tasks.md` and make one atomic
  commit for that item instead of bundling multiple finished tasks into a
  single commit.

- One branch should track only one active complex topic in `tasks.md` at a
  time.

- Once all checklist items are complete and the topic no longer needs active
  execution tracking, deleting `tasks.md` is required.

- When Claude is asked for a commit-sized change, run the smallest relevant
  verification first and widen only when shared contracts are affected.

- Keep commit hygiene aligned with the shared repository rule set:
  Conventional Commit subjects, English-only code-facing text, and no skipped
  migration review after backend schema changes.

- If a task changes only docs or AI-instruction files, the minimum
  verification target is `python scripts/check_ai_collab_docs.py`.
